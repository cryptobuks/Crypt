#Crypt
Crypt is a system for centrally storing FileVault 2 recovery keys. It is made up of a client app, and a Django web app for storing the keys. You will also need to [download and install the webapp](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt-Server).

##Changes in this version
* 10.7 is no longer supported.
* Improved logging on errors.
* Improved user feedback during long operations (such as enabling FileVault).

##Client
The client is written in Pyobjc, and makes use of  the built in fdesetup on OS X 10.8 and higher. An example login hook is provided to see how this could be implemented in your organisation. 

###Features
- If escrow fails for some reason, the recovery key is stored on disk and a Launch Daemon will attempt to escrow the key periodically.
- If the app cannot contact the server, it can optionally quit.
- If FileVault is already enabled, the app will quit.

###Installation
- Install the [package](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt/releases) 
- Install the [Django webapp](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt-Server)

###Configuration
``sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/FVServer ServerURL "http://yourserver.com"``

To disable the network check (for example, in environments when the network isn't available until the user has authenticated):
``sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/FVServer NetworkCheck -bool NO``

``fdesetup``, the binary Crypt uses to enable FileVault needs to be run as root. You will need to devise your own way of running this, whether it is via a LaunchDaemon or a LoginHook.
